***Design of a Si Carrier-Depletion-Type Mach-Zehnder Modulator with Ultra-Compact Photonic Crystal Slow-Light Phase Shifter***          
2024 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics Pacific Rim (Accepted)          

**Abstract:** A Si Mach-Zehnder modulator using an ultra-compact photonic crystal slow-light
phase shifter of 22 µm is numerically studied. The modulator exhibits an ultra-small V<sub>π</sub>L of
4.76 × 10<sup>-2</sup> V⋅cm and clearly opened-eye at 15 Gbit/s..

***Power-efficient 2 × 2 Si Mach-Zehnder interferometer optical switch utilizing compact slow-light phase shifter***          
[2024 IEEE Silicon Photonics Conference](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10543281)           

**Abstract:** A novel Si Mach-Zehnder interferometer optical
switch is numerically studied. Through utilizing the photonic
crystal waveguide in the perturbed kagome lattice with a high
group index, a compact phase shifter of 17.7 um is designed, and a
low switching power of 305 uW is confirmed.

***Numerical Demonstration of Silicon Micro-Ring Modulator with X-Interleaved PN Junction for High Modulation Efficiency***          
[2023 Acia Communications and Photonics Conference and Exhibition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10369178)          

**Abstract:** In order to improve the modulation efficiency of a silicon-based carrier-depletion micro-ring modulator (MRM), a 3D X-interleaved PN junction structure is introduced in the modulation region. The static and dynamic performance of the proposed MRM is compared with the MRM with the previously reported lateral-zigzag PN junction using numerical simulation. Compared to the lateral-zigzag type MRM, the proposed MRM exhibits a 16.7% higher modulation efficiency of 70-pm/V and 2-GHz narrower 3-dB bandwidth of 31-GHz at the bias voltage of −1.0 V. Despite the slightly narrower bandwidth, non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modulation operation indicates that the X-interleaved type MRM can provide 1.7 dB larger dynamic extinction ratio of 4.46 dB at 40-Gbit/s operation with 1.0-V pp driving voltage due to its higher modulation efficiency. It also consumes a 38% lower power of 16.36 fJ/bit to generate a 40-Gbit/s optical signal with an extinction ratio of 4.77 dB. These results indicate that the MRM with X-interleaved PN junction has a potential for application in large-scale high-speed photonic integrated circuits.

***Design of a MMI-Based All-Optical AND-NAND-NOT and NOR-OR Multilogic Gate for Binary-Phase-Shift-Keyed Signal***          
[2022 Acia Communications and Photonics Conference and Exhibition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10088751)          

**Abstract:** All optical multilogic gate functions, AND, NAND, NOT, NOR, and OR, are numerically demonstrated with an identical 3×3 multimode interference coupler. A contrast ratio of greater than 9.5 dB is achieved for all functions.

***Study on silicon photonic crystal slow-light waveguide in a perturbed kagome lattice structure***          
[2022 IEICE Technical Report](https://ken.ieice.org/ken/paper/20221021GCN2/eng/)          

**Abstract:** To improve the tradeoff between group index and low-group-velocity-dispersion bandwidth, Si slow-light photonic crystal waveguide with lattice shift in perturbed kagome lattice structure is studied. According to numerical calculations, it can achieve a medium group index of about 60 with a low-dispersion bandwidth of 5.5 nm despite using single slab material and uniform unit-cell design.
