Foreword 
======

In this blog the details of the basic knowledge will not be summarized. I strongly recommend the book from MIT "Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light".

<!-- The main task in my research is Si-based 2D photonic crystals on the SOI platform in the on-chip application. The examples in the following blogs are mainly 2D photonic crystals -->

Meanwhile, just learning basic knowledge is sometimes 'boring', So, I recommend you to do some simulations while learning basic knowledge.

<!-- 光子晶体的非常基础的内容在这里就不总结了，如果有需要的话我非常建议去看一下MIT的John D. Joannopoulos等人写的"Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light"，这本书好像国内已经有翻译版本了，是谭海云，吴雪梅老师的翻译版 “光子晶体 -控制光流”。

我的研究主要集中在硅基的二维光子晶体的片上应用，所以之后的分享的案例仿真会集中在二维光子晶体上面。

我建议在学习基础知识的时候穿插一些仿真工作，这样既能避免学习的无聊，也可以加深一些对光子晶体的理解。 -->

Learning resources 
====== 

* Joannopoulos Research Group at MIT --> [Link](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/about.html)
1. Book "Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light" --> [Check it](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/book/)
2. The lecture slides, --> [Check it](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/photons/tutorial/)

The basic knowledge of photonic crystal is summarized on their group website. Reading books, checking lecture slides and demos are helpful.

<!-- 光子晶体相关的基础知识我建议去查看MIT Joannopoulos Research Group的网站。网站上有免费提供的pdf版本的光子晶体书籍以及有相关课程的ppt，看书和ppt对于入门这个学科很重要，我建议前期可以多看看打好基础。在研究过程中也经常会有不太明白的也要去在书里找线索。 -->

* Youtube lectures
1. Circuit using photonic crystals (From NTT) --> [Check it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to21DMDmR54&t=11s)
2. NanoHub-U channel: Nanophotonic modeling --> [Check it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MajJX27I2BM&list=PLtkeUZItwHK7THwQcs3D48lfEAe-fDiBn&index=1)

NanoHub-U also has their own website,([Link](https://nanohub.org/)) There are some lectures and tools, I'm not familiar with this site so if you are interested, please check it.

<!-- youtube有很多光子晶体相关的介绍和教程视频，对二维光子晶体器件结构介绍可以参考NTT的视频（第一个链接）[b站搬运](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1BR4y1s7nu/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=a8dfdde41a35f956dd35800952dcf5ae)。youtube上Nanohub-U频道也有涉及到光子晶体的完整教学视频，可以去了解背景知识[b站搬运目前还没找到 QAQ]。 -->

Simulation Toos
======

Simulation software is a tool to evaluation your design before farbrication and experiment. In research, your ideas/designs are most important, please don't put the cart before the horse.

<!-- 在研究过程中，仿真只是用来验证我们的想法的工具，仿真固然很重要，但请注意研究中最重要的是我们的想法，设计，所以请注意仿真在研究中的位置，请不要舍本逐末。 -->

Some popular commercial simulation software. 
I will give suggestions based on my own experiences:

* [COMSOL Multiphysics:](https://www.comsol.jp/)
  1. Feature:               (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) 
  2. License requirements:  (&hearts; &hearts; ) Paid License required, student free license is not available, evaluation license can be provided.
  3. Ease of Learning:      (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Demos are provided.

* [Ansys Lumerical:](https://www.lumerical.com/)
  1. Feature:               (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) 
  2. License requirements:  (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Paid License required, student free license is not available, evaluation license can be provided.
  3. Ease of Learning:      (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Demos are provided.

* [Synopsys Rsoft:](https://www.synopsys.com/ja-jp/optical-solutions/rsoft-photonic-device-tools.html)
  1. Feature:               (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) 
  2. License requirements:  (&hearts; &hearts;) Paid License required, student free license is not available.
  3. Ease of Learning:      (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Demos are provided.

If the license is available by yourself or in your lab, the commercial software is better for their graphic interface. 

If the license is not available and the high-performance simulation is also needed, I recommend you to try Opensource software. Unfortunately, the most commonly used Opensource software in this research field doesn't have a graphic, meanwhile, there are very few tutorials online.

I will recommend some of my familiar Opensource software below.

* [MIT MEEP:](https://github.com/NanoComp)
  1. Feature:               ((&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) 
  2. License requirements:  ((&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Opensource license.
  3. Ease of Learning:      ((&hearts; / &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Difficult for beginners (&hearts;), but it has a Python interface(&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;).

* [Stanford, fan group, Legume:](https://github.com/fancompute)
  1. Feature:               (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Powerful computing of the layered photonic crystals.
  2. License requirements:  (&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Opensource license.
  3. Ease of Learning:      ((&hearts; / &hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;) Difficult for beginners (&hearts;), but it has a Python interface(&hearts; &hearts; &hearts; &hearts;).

There are also many excellent Opensource simulation software available, CHECK [software developed by fan group](https://github.com/fancompute), CHECK [GDS factory](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory), etc. Most of them have the Python interface. 

Based on my experience using commercial software for several years, I can say that, sometimes, the Opensource software can do specific jobs more efficiently.

Other recommended options
====== 

<!-- 取决于你的研究方向，入门过程仅仅了解光子晶体的相关知识也是不够的，一些和你的研究方向息息相关的知识也是必须要去尽力了解和掌握的。 -->
At least, you need to get familiar to these fields.
<!-- 以我的研究方向为例，我分享一下非常建议去学习一下的知识。 -->
<!--1. Semiconductor and solid state physics many books and learning resources available, you can choose the resources you like by yourself  -->
1. Semiconductor and solid state physics: Choose any one you like
2. Photonics --> Recommend: [Photonics, Optical Electronics in Modern Communications](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/photonics-9780195179460?cc=jp&lang=en&)
3. Silicon photonics --> Recommend: [Silicon photonics design, from devices to systems](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/silicon-photonics-design/BF3CF13E8542BCE67FD2BBC7104ECEAB)


Ending
======
Compare with other optical device simulations, the simulation of photonic crystal is 'HEAVY LOAD' because nanostructures require a high-quality mesh/resolution. 

Evaluating photonic crystals is a kind of task full of challenges.

I hope everyone enjoys their research and take care.
