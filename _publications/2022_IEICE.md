collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-conf-3
excerpt: 'To improve the tradeoff between group index and low-group-velocity-dispersion bandwidth, Si slow-light photonic crystal waveguide with lattice shift in perturbed kagome lattice structure is studied. According to numerical calculations, it can achieve a medium group index of about 60 with a low-dispersion bandwidth of 5.5 nm despite using single slab material and uniform unit-cell design.'

To improve the tradeoff between group index and low-group-velocity-dispersion bandwidth, Si slow-light photonic crystal waveguide with lattice shift in perturbed kagome lattice structure is studied. According to numerical calculations, it can achieve a medium group index of about 60 with a low-dispersion bandwidth of 5.5 nm despite using single slab material and uniform unit-cell design.
