This is a talk in "The 15th International collaboration Symposium on Information, Production and Systems (ISIPS 2021)".

The dispersion in group index (𝑛𝑔) of the kagome lattice Si photonic crystal (PhC) waveguide, which can
provide a high group index for the guided light, is studied based on dispersion engineering. By adjusting the
width of the PhC waveguide, the wide-range 𝑛𝑔 tuning from 80 to 180 is numerically demonstrated.
