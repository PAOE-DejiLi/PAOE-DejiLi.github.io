This is a talk in "The 14th International collaboration Symposium on Information, Production and Systems (ISIPS 2020)".

For increase in optical coupling between fiber and a silicon-on-insulator waveguide, an improved design of the
folk-type MSC is proposed. The new design numerically demonstrates the coupling efficiency of -1.40 and -1.93
dB for TE and TM mode, respectively. It also improves fiber misalignment tolerances.
