This is a talk in "The 16th International collaboration Symposium on Information, Production and Systems (ISIPS 2022)".

Si photonic crystal slow-light waveguide with lattice-shifted structure in the perturbed kagome lattice is
designed. Both the group index and low-dispersion bandwidth are enhanced by applying perturbation and lattice
shift on a Si photonic crystal waveguide in the kagome lattice. With numerical calculation, an optimal group index
of 60 with a low-dispersion bandwidth of 5.5 nm is obtained.
